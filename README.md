# DLL-EXE-OBFUSCATOR
Made by AI but works for DLLs and EXEs



DONT UPLOAD THE OUTPUT IN VIRUSTOTAL 
Alright listen up: don’t be that guy who uploads your obfuscated .exe or .dll to VirusTotal. Seriously.

When you do that, you’re not just checking if it's safe  you’re basically handing your file to every antivirus company on the planet. And guess what? They’re not gonna throw you a thank-you party. Instead:

Your file gets flagged just because it looks “suspicious” (thanks to all the obfuscation magic).

AV companies use it to train their scanners.

Now your clean file gets marked as a trojan on every system. Forever.

GG. Your project is toast before it even started.
